# STM32L4 and DST_TH58BVG3S0HTAI0 NAND Memory Interfacing

This project demonstrates the interfacing of the STM32L4 microcontroller with the DST_TH58BVG3S0HTAI0 NAND memory chip using the Flexible Memory Controller (FMC). It includes read, write, and page programming operations and is implemented in STM32CubeIDE.

---

## Project Overview
This project interfaces the STM32L4 MCU with a NAND memory to perform the following operations:
- Initialize the FMC peripheral for communication.
- Write data to a specified NAND memory page.
- Read data from a specified NAND memory page.
- Verify data integrity between write and read operations.

---

## Hardware Requirements
- STM32L4 Microcontroller (e.g., STM32L4S5VI)
- NAND Memory Chip: DST_TH58BVG3S0HTAI0
- Power supply and connections for VCC and GND
- GPIO pins for FMC signals (CE, WE, RE, CLE, ALE, RY/BY, D0-D7)

---

## Software Requirements
- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
- STM32CubeMX for initial configuration
- STM32 HAL Drivers

## How to Use
1. Hardware Setup:
   - Connect the STM32 pins to the NAND chip as per the Pin Interfacing table.
   - Ensure VCC and GND are properly connected.

2. Project Configuration:
   - Open STM32CubeIDE and load the provided project.
   - Configure the FMC peripheral for NAND communication in `MX_FMC_Init`.

3. Running the Application:
   - Build and flash the project onto the STM32L4 MCU.
   - The application will perform a write-read-verify cycle and indicate success or failure.

4. Debugging:
   - Use a debugger to step through the operations.
   - Verify GPIO states for commands, address latching, and data transfers.

## Example Code Snippet
```c
// Write data to NAND page 0
uint8_t write_data[4224];
memset(write_data, 0xAA, sizeof(write_data));
NAND_WritePage(write_data, 0);

// Read data from NAND page 0
uint8_t read_data[4224];
NAND_ReadPage(read_data, 0);

// Verify data
if (memcmp(write_data, read_data, sizeof(write_data)) == 0)
{
    // Data match
}
else
{
    // Data mismatch
}
```
